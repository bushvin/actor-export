        **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for actor-export!**
        ðŸ’¡
        Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
        would be useful for majority of the actor-export module users.
        As a general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest
        to a small sub group can be implemented using the *Custom Integration*.

        If unsure, consider contacting us on the
        [#actor-export](https://discord.gg/6U89NQrtyS) Discord channel.

        Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
        GitHub][issue search].

        What's the problem this feature will solve?

        What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
        with actor-export as it currently stands?


        * Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable
        and how it solves the problem you described.

        * How do you solve this now?

        * Have you tried to work around the problem using other tools?

        * Could there be a different approach to solving this issue?

        I am trying to do X with actor-export and I think that
        implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
        every other user of actor-export because of Z.
