        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        âš 
        Verify first that your issue is not [already reported on
        GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind that we may have to keep
        the current behavior because [every change breaks someone's
        workflow][XKCD 1172].
        We try to be mindful about this.
